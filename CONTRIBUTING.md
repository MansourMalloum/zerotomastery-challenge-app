# Contributing

We use the
[standard fork and pull request workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

Branches:

- master - Always deployable, production quality branch, don't touch
- dev - Pull requests are sent here from the feature branches
- feature branch - Where all your individual features are made

To go into a bit more detail, what you wanna do is make a feature branch (name
it appropriately) and work on your code there. When you are finished, make a
pull request (PR) to the dev branch. The project leads will then look at it and
merge if the code looks good. Remember to pull from the remote repo before
pushing your code to your local repo. See:
[how to sync a fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork).
